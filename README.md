# React Hooks

In this session, we are going to practice the basics of React hooks. We will be focusing on the most two used hooks: `useState` and `useEffect`. We will practice also how can we create our custom hook!

For other hooks such as `useContext`, you will practice them in _Advanced React_ sessions with Sohaib Zouambia.

## First Milestone: Practicing `useState` & `useEffect`

### Simple Counter app

To better understand what really is `useState` and what's all about it, we're going to see it in a very basic, yet useful example: _Counter example_.

Create a simple counter React application that should allow a user to:

- Display the current counter value
- Increment and decrement counter value by 1
- Increment counter value by custom value introduced by the user
- Reset counter value
- Update the document title so it displays how many times the counter value changed

### FAQ section

You remember the FAQ Section you were asked to implement its UI using Tailwindcss in React JS? It's time to complete its functionality by allowing the user to toggle the visibility of questions' answers.

## Second Milestone: Implementing our own custom hook

### `useDarkMode` hook

Create a custom hook on the previous react application to toggle between light and dark mode. The latest theme set by the user should be saved in local storage, so when the user refreshes the page, the latest theme will be kept.

## Third Milestone: Making it all together

Recreate the todo app we practiced before using Vanillajs using this time Reactjs and its powerful features, e.g. hooks.
After completing the app, how do you feel writing it in Reactjs compared to Vanillajs? Did you write more code or less code?
